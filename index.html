Like I'm half of a whole.<br>
Without you, I've got no hand to hold.<br>

Without you, I'm just a sad song.<br>
I'm just a sad song.<br>

With you I fall.<br>
It's like I'm leaving all my past in silhouettes upon the wall.<br>
With you I'm a beautiful mess.<br>
It's like we're standing hand in hand with all our fears upon the edge.<br>
<br>
So stop time right here in the moonlight,<br>

Without you, I've got no hand to hold.<br>

You're the perfect melody,<br>

I wanna hear.<br>
You're my favorite part of me,<br>

    <p>We&rsquo;re all the same <br>
No matter how we&rsquo;ve grown <br>
Colors of our skin <br>
Defections in our bones <br>
<br>
There's one thing we share <br>
Everyone everywhere <br>
We're all alone <br>
We're all alone. <br>
<br>
Everyone is fundamentally lonely <br>
Whether you trust science or a church <br>
Because we&rsquo;re scared <br>
Some of us make pairs <br>
And some of us are still on the search <br>
<br>
But everyone is fundamentally lonely <br>
So here&rsquo;s daily advice <br>
You&rsquo;re in pain <br>
And everyone feels the same <br>
So just be ..... nice. <br>
<br>
What do you lose <br>
When life&rsquo;s already the worst <br>
Leave a bigger tip <br>
Let that guy in line first <br>
<br>
We&rsquo;re all lonely <br>
Pay for their coffee <br>
Pick up that trash <br>
I know it&rsquo;s not your trash. <br>
<br>
Everyone is fundamentally lonely <br>
Sometimes it comes out as rage <br>
Screaming in a store <br>
Cause they&rsquo;re lonely at the core <br>
So be calm when you engage <br>
<br>
Everyone is fundamentally lonely <br>
And I&rsquo;m not saying to sacrifice <br>
Lend some support <br>
At the airport <br>
It won&rsquo;t kill you to be nice. <br>
<br>
Everything is stupid <br>
Success is a projection <br>
We&rsquo;re all quietly helpless <br>
Being nice is a connection <br>
<br>
Blaring your car horn <br>
Won&rsquo;t make you feel tremendous <br>
But picking up something someone dropped <br>
Will make this whole thing less horrendous <br>
<br>
Everyone is fundamentally lonely <br>
Even the ones who pretend they&rsquo;re not <br>
Be nice today <br>
It&rsquo;ll make things just slightly ok <br>
On this lonely, little blue dot.

    <p>I woke up cryin' late at night when I was very young<br>
I had dreamed my father had passed away and gone<br>
My world revolved around him, I couldn't lie there anymore<br>
So I made my way down the mirrored hall<br>
And tapped upon his door<br>
<br>
And I said, &quot;Daddy, I'm so afraid<br>
How will I go on, with you gone that way?<br>
Don't wanna cry anymore so may I stay with you?&quot;<br>
And he said, &quot;That's my job, that's what I do<br>
Everything I do is because of you<br>
To keep you safe with me, that's my job, you see.&quot;<br>
<br>
Later we barely got along, this teenage boy and he<br>
Most of the fights it seems were over different dreams<br>
We each held for me<br>
He wanted knowledge and learning, I wanted to fly out west<br>
I said, &quot;I could make it out there if I just had the fare<br>
I got half, will you loan me the rest?&quot;<br>
<br>
And I said, &quot;Daddy, I'm so afraid<br>
There's no guarantee in the plans I've made<br>
And if I should fail, who will pay my way back home?&quot;<br>
And he said, &quot;That's my job, that's what I do<br>
Everything I do is because of you<br>
To keep you safe with me, that's my job, you see.&quot;<br>
<br>
Every person carves his spot and fills the hole with life<br>
And I pray someday I might light as bright as he<br>
<br>
Woke up early one bright fall day to spread the tragic news<br>
After all my travel, I settled down within a mile or two<br>
I make my livin' with words and rhymes and all this tragedy<br>
Should go into my head and out instead as bits of poetry<br>
<br>
But I say, &quot;Daddy I'm so afraid<br>
How will I go on with you gone this way?<br>
How can I come up with a song to say, I love you?&quot;<br>
&quot;That's my job, that's what I do<br>
Everything I do is because of you<br>
To keep you safe with me, that's my job, you see.&quot;<br>
&quot;Everything I do is because of you<br>
To keep you safe with me.&quot;

    <p>Now Daddy didn't like trouble, but if it came along<br>
Everyone that knew him knew which side that he'd be on<br>
He never was a hero, or this county's shinin' light<br>
But you could always find him standin' up<br>
For what he thought was right<br>
<br>
He'd say, &quot;You've got to stand for something or you'll fall for anything<br>
You've got to be your own man not a puppet on a string<br>
Never compromise what's right and uphold your family name<br>
You've got to stand for something or you'll fall for anything&quot;<br>
<br>
Now we might've been better off or owned a bigger house<br>
If Daddy had done more givin' in or a little more backin' down<br>
But we always had plenty just living his advice<br>
&quot;Whatever you do today you'll have to sleep with tonight&quot;<br>
<br>
He'd say, &quot;You've got to stand for something or you'll fall for anything<br>
You've got to be your own man, not a puppet on a string<br>
Never compromise what's right, and uphold your family name<br>
You've got to stand for something or you'll fall for anything&quot;<br>
<br>
And I know that things are different than they were in Daddy's day<br>
But I still believe what makes a man really hasn't changed<br>
<br>
You've got to stand for something or you'll fall for anything<br>
You've got to be your own man, not a puppet on a string<br>
Never compromise what's right, and uphold your family name<br>
You've got to stand for something or you'll fall for anything<br>
You've got to stand for something or you'll fall for anything

    <p>You know.. the bed feels warmer<br>
Sleeping here alone<br>
You know I dream in colour<br>
And do the things I want<br>
<br>
You think you got the best of me<br>
Think you've had the last laugh<br>
Bet you think that everything good is gone<br>
Think you left me broken down<br>
Think that I'd come running back<br>
Baby you don't know me, cause you're dead wrong<br>
<br>
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger<br>
Stand a little taller<br>
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone<br>
What doesn't kill you makes a fighter<br>
Footsteps even lighter<br>
Doesn't mean I'm over cause you're gone<br>
<br>
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger<br>
Just me, myself and I<br>
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger<br>
Stand a little taller<br>
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone<br>
<br>
You heard that I was starting over with someone new<br>
They told you I was moving on over you<br>
<br>
You didn't think that I'd come back<br>
I'd come back swinging<br>
You try to break me, but you see<br>

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger<br>
Stand a little taller<br>
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone<br>
What doesn't kill you makes a fighter<br>
Footsteps even lighter<br>
Doesn't mean I'm over cause you're gone<br>
<br>
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger<br>
Just me, myself and I<br>
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger<br>
Stand a little taller<br>
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone<br>
<br>
Thanks to you I got a new thing started<br>
Thanks to you I'm not the broken-hearted<br>
Thanks to you I'm finally thinking about me<br>
You know in the end the day you left was just my beginning<br>
In the end...<br>
<br>
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger<br>
Stand a little taller<br>
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone<br>
What doesn't kill you makes a fighter<br>
Footsteps even lighter<br>
Doesn't mean I'm over cause you're gone<br>
<br>
[2x]<br>
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger<br>
Just me, myself and I<br>
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger<br>
Stand a little taller<br>
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone<br>
<br>
(When I'm alone)

    <p>A winter's day<br>
In a deep and dark December<br>
I am alone<br>
Gazing from my window<br>
To the streets below<br>
On a freshly fallen, silent shroud of snow<br>
I am a rock<br>
I am an island<br>
<br>
I've built walls<br>
A fortress, steep and mighty<br>
That none may penetrate<br>
I have no need of friendship<br>
Friendship causes pain.<br>
It's laughter and it's loving I disdain.<br>
I am a rock<br>
I am an island<br>
<br>
Don't talk of love<br>
Well, I've heard the words before<br>
It's sleeping in my memory<br>
And I won't disturb the slumber<br>
Of feelings that have died<br>
If I never loved, I never would have cried<br>
I am a rock<br>
I am an island<br>
<br>
I have my books<br>
And my poetry to protect me<br>
I am shielded in my armor<br>
Hiding in my room<br>
Safe within my womb<br>
I touch no one and no one touches me<br>
I am a rock<br>
I am an island<br>

And a rock feels no pain<br>
And an island never cries<br>

because no one is<br>
better than someone else is<br>
I'm down with women's circumcision<br>
So if you feel like I do,<br>
(Your a homo)<br>
Take your ballsack and your bongo drum,<br>
and sing this gay ass little song<br>
<br>
Black people are good at stealing stereos!<br>
They've got Jewish lawyers in court<br>
Muslims are the best at flying into stuff<br>
Not all Muslims, just most,<br>
and all it takes is most<br>
<br>
Africans like lynching homosexuals<br>
Cubans turn dildos into boats<br>
Germans kidnap girls and<br>
make them prostitutes<br>
Everyone's special<br>
in their own gay little way<br>
<br>
Arab girls have got to be sweaty<br>
They put to death<br>
if they show they tittie<br>
That's baller shit,<br>
I ain't even playin'<br>
Lemme tell you<br>
what's the same about the<br>
Swedish, Chassidish<br>
Jews, Kelly and Regis<br>
They're all fuckin' crazy!<br>
Except the Swedish,<br>
they're just lazy,<br>
and love the penis<br>
Yeah, those ladies in Sweden<br>
got enough VDs to turn<br>
those dudes around them gay<br>
And Frenchmen don't believe in bathing<br>
and Haitians love a good earthquake<br>
Caging a Mongol?<br>
Russian tradition<br>
Rape in the Congo?<br>
As long as it's women<br>
Taking a dump on someone else's culture<br>
and making fun of them<br>
just 'cause they're different<br>
and making a song calling<br>
their country stupid,<br>
mixing the absurd with the true?<br>
Don't to it<br>
So if you hate racist humour,<br>
get your pooper up,<br>
and sing this fuckin' song!<br>
<br>
Black people are good<br>
at wheelchair basketball<br>
They got shot,<br>
and now cannot walk<br>
Pregnant girls are stupid and impossible<br>
Everyone's good,<br>
no one is better than someone<br>
<br>
White people can<br>
show black people how to vote<br>
Blacks could teach<br>
them Jews to dance good<br>
Blind black men can't play hockey,<br>
'cause they're black<br>
Helen Keller can't drive<br>
because she's a woman<br>
<br>
Gary Coleman's gone<br>
It was so sad, <br>
he was so young<br>
I mean he was like fifty-one<br>
but it's sad.<br>
because he looked like<br>
he was nine years old<br>
Whatchu' talkin' about, Rucka?<br>
His wife did it!<br>
<br>
I love minorities

Ain't got no cash, ain't got no style<br>
Ain't got no gal to make you smile<br>

'Cause when you worry your face will frown<br>
And that will bring everybody down<br>
So don't worry, be happy<br>
Don't worry, be happy now<br>

    <p>I was walkin' through the city streets<br>
And a man walks up to me<br>
and hands me the latest energy drink<br>
&quot;Run faster, jump higher&quot;<br>
Man, I'm not gonna let you poison me<br>
<br>
I threw it on the ground<br>
You must think I'm a joke<br>
I ain't gonna be part of your system<br>
Man!<br>
Pump that garbage<br>
in another man's veins<br>
<br>
I go to my favorite hot dog stand<br>
And the dude says,<br>
&quot;You come here all the time! Here's one for free.&quot;<br>
I said, &quot;Man!<br>
What do I look like?<br>
A charity case?&quot;<br>
<br>
I took it and threw it on the ground!<br>
I don't need your handouts!<br>
I'm an adult!<br>
Please!<br>
You can't buy me hot dog, man!<br>
<br>
At the farmer's market<br>
with my so called girlfriend<br>
She hands me her cell phone,<br>
says it's my dad<br>
Man, this ain't my dad!<br>
This is a cell phone!<br>
<br>
I threw it on the ground!<br>
What, you think I'm stupid?<br>
I'm not a part of your system<br>
My dad's not a phone!<br>
DUH!<br>
<br>
Some poser hands me<br>
cake at a birthday party<br>
Whatcha want me to do with this?<br>
Eat it?<br>
<br>
Happy birthday to the ground!<br>
I threw the rest of the cake, too!<br>
Welcome to the real word, jackass!<br>
<br>
So many things to<br>
throw on the ground<br>
Like this, and this,<br>
and that, and even this<br>
I'm an ADULT!<br>
<br>
Two Hollywood phonies<br>
try to give me their autograph<br>
GROUND!<br>
Nobody wants your autograph,<br>
phonies!<br>
<br>
Then the two phonies got up<br>
Turned out they had a taser<br>
And they tased me in the butthole<br>
<br>
Fell to the ground<br>
The phonies didn't let up<br>
Tasin' on my butthole over and over<br>
<br>
I was screamin' and squirmin'<br>
My butthole was on fire<br>
The moral of the story is<br>
<br>
You can't trust the system<br>

Where the bus at?<br>
Got my bus pass<br>
Bus in much better than a train (than a train)<br>

Take phone pictures<br>
While I&rsquo;m waiting at the bus stop<br>
Bus not here<br>
Why the bus so late?<br>

I&rsquo;m waiting for the bus in the rain<br>
Wishing I was on the bus<br>
When the bus drive around your estate<br>
<br>
Oh, good here comes the bus-<br>
Aw, shit! It&rsquo;s a different bus<br>
Not the right bus<br>
Not the bus I need<br>

Bus ain&rsquo;t got a real high speed<br>

Blue one<br>
A red one<br>
All of &lsquo;em turned away<br>

Gotta catch a bus<br>
Gotta watch news<br>
Got a regimented plan for the day<br>
Bus<br>

Wait-waiting for the bus in the rain<br>
Waiting for the bus in the rain, in the rain<br>
Wait-waiting for the bus in the rain<br>

Now there&rsquo;s other people waiting at the bus stop<br>
Hey, where&rsquo;s your bus pass, boy?<br>
When you&rsquo;re waiting for the bus in the rain,<br>
have your bus pass ready<br>
or the people on the bus get annoyed!<br>
<br>
I&rsquo;m waiting for the bus<br>
Like I do everyday on my way home<br>
Waiting for the bus in the rain<br>
(At least on the days when it&rsquo;s raining<br>
And I&rsquo;m waiting for the bus<br>
Cause the other days ain&rsquo;t the same)<br>

Waiting for the bus in the rain, in the rain<br>
Wait-waiting for the bus in the rain<br>

Waiting for a bus in the rain<br>

Waiting for the bus so hard sometimes<br>
When the bus come late to the stop<br>
Waiting for the bus in the rain man<br>
I prefer sunshine<br>
Should be waiting for the bus with a mop<br>

I believe I can fly<br>
I believe I can fly<br>

See I was on the verge of breaking down<br>
Sometimes silence can seem so loud<br>
There are miracles in life I must achieve<br>

    <p>Hey there, Delilah<br>
What's it like in New York City?<br>
I'm a thousand miles away<br>
But girl, tonight you look so pretty<br>
Yes you do<br>
Times Square can't shine as bright as you<br>
I swear it's true<br>
<br>
Hey there, Delilah<br>
Don't you worry about the distance<br>
I'm right there if you get lonely<br>
Give this song another listen<br>
Close your eyes<br>
Listen to my voice, it's my disguise<br>
I'm by your side<br>
<br>
Oh it's what you do to me<br>
Oh it's what you do to me<br>
Oh it's what you do to me<br>
Oh it's what you do to me<br>
What you do to me<br>
<br>
Hey there, Delilah<br>
I know times are getting hard<br>
But just believe me, girl<br>
Someday I'll pay the bills with this guitar<br>
We'll have it good<br>
We'll have the life we knew we would<br>
My word is good<br>
<br>
Hey there, Delilah<br>
I've got so much left to say<br>
If every simple song I wrote to you<br>
Would take your breath away<br>
I'd write it all<br>
Even more in love with me you'd fall<br>
We'd have it all<br>
<br>
Oh it's what you do to me<br>
Oh it's what you do to me<br>
Oh it's what you do to me<br>
Oh it's what you do to me<br>
<br>
A thousand miles seems pretty far<br>
But they've got planes and trains and cars<br>
I'd walk to you if I had no other way<br>
Our friends would all make fun of us<br>
and we'll just laugh along because we know<br>
That none of them have felt this way<br>
Delilah, I can promise you<br>
That by the time that we get through<br>
The world will never ever be the same<br>
And you're to blame<br>
<br>
Hey there, Delilah<br>
You be good and don't you miss me<br>
Two more years and you'll be done with school<br>
And I'll be making history like I do<br>
You'll know it's all because of you<br>
We can do whatever we want to<br>
Hey there, Delilah, here's to you<br>
This one's for you<br>
<br>
Oh it's what you do to me<br>
Oh it's what you do to me<br>
Oh it's what you do to me<br>
Oh it's what you do to me<br>
What you do to me.<br>

    <p>Hello, it's me<br>
I was wondering if after all<br>
these years you'd like to meet<br>
To go over everything<br>
They say that time's supposed to heal ya<br>
But I ain't done much healing<br>
Hello, can you hear me?<br>
I'm in California dreaming about<br>
who we used to be<br>
When we were younger and free<br>
I've forgotten how it felt<br>
Before the world fell at our feet<br>
<br>
There's such a difference between us<br>
And a million miles<br>
<br>
Hello from the other side<br>
I must have called a thousand times<br>
To tell you I'm sorry<br>
for everything that I've done<br>
But when I call you never seem to be home<br>
Hello from the outside<br>
At least I can say that I've tried<br>
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart<br>
But it don't matter,<br>
it clearly doesn't tear you apart<br>
Anymore<br>
<br>
Hello, how are you?<br>
It's so typical of me to talk about myself,<br>
I'm sorry<br>
I hope that you're well<br>
Did you ever make it out of that town<br>
Where nothing ever happened?<br>
<br>
It's no secret that the both of us<br>
Are running out of time<br>
<br>
So hello from the other side<br>
(other side)<br>
I must have called a thousand times<br>
(thousand times)<br>
To tell you I'm sorry<br>
for everything that I've done<br>
But when I call you never seem to be home<br>
Hello from the outside (outside)<br>
At least I can say that I've tried (I've tried)<br>
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart<br>
But it don't matter,<br>
it clearly doesn't tear you apart<br>
Anymore<br>
<br>
Anymore<br>
Anymore<br>
Anymore<br>
Anymore<br>
<br>
Hello from the other side (other side)<br>

    <p>He was sitting there beside me<br>
throwing doubles down<br>
When he ordered up his third one<br>
he looked around<br>
Then he looked at me,<br>
said I do believe I'll have one more<br>
He said I hate this bar<br>
and I hate to drink<br>
But on second thought tonight<br>
I think I hate everything<br>
<br>
Then he opened up his bill-fold<br>
and threw a 20 down<br>
And the faded photograph fell out<br>
and hit the ground<br>
And I picked it up, he said thank you bud,<br>
I put it in his hand<br>
He said I probably ought<br>
to throw this one away<br>
'Cause she's the reason I feel this way,<br>
I hate everything<br>
<br>
I hate my job, I hate my life and if it weren't for my two kids I'd hate my ex-wife<br>
I know I should move on and try to start again<br>
But I just can't get over her leaving me for him<br>
Then he shook his head and looked down at his ring and said I hate everything<br>
<br>
He said one bedroom apartment where I get my mail<br>
Is really not a home, it's more like a jail<br>
With a swimming pool and a parking lot view, man that's just great<br>
I hate summer, winter, fall and spring<br>
Red and yellow, purple, blue and green, I hate everything<br>
<br>
<br>
So I pulled out my phone and I called my house<br>
I said babe I'm comin' home, we're gonna work this out<br>
I paid for his drinks and I told him thanks, thanks for everything

    <p>Today I don't feel like doing anything<br>
I just wanna lay in my bed<br>
Don't feel like picking up my phone<br>
So leave a message at the tone<br>
'Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything.<br>
<br>
Uh!<br>
I'm gonna kick my feet up<br>
Then stare at the fan<br>
Turn the TV on, throw my hand in my pants<br>
Nobody's gonna tell me I can't<br>
<br>
I'll be lounging on the couch,<br>
Just chillin' in my snuggie<br>
Click to MTV, so they can teach me how to dougie<br>
'Cause in my castle I'm the freaking man<br>
<br>
Oh, yes I said it<br>
I said it<br>
I said it 'cause I can<br>
<br>
Today I don't feel like doing anything<br>
I just wanna lay in my bed<br>
Don't feel like picking up my phone<br>

Nothing at all!<br>
Ooh, hoo, ooh, hoo, ooh, ooh-ooh<br>
Nothing at all<br>
Ooh, hoo, ooh, hoo, ooh, ooh-ooh<br>
<br>
Tomorrow I'll wake up, do some P90X<br>
Meet a really nice girl, have some really nice sex<br>
And she's gonna scream out:<br>
'This is Great' (Oh my God, this is great!)<br>
Yeah<br>
<br>
I might mess around, and get my college degree<br>
I bet my old man will be so proud of me<br>
But sorry pops, you'll just have to wait<br>
Haha<br>
<br>
Oh, yes I said it<br>
I said it<br>
I said it 'cause I can<br>

Today I don't feel like doing anything<br>
I just wanna lay in my bed<br>
Don't feel like picking up my phone<br>
So leave a message at the tone<br>
'Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything<br>
<br>
No, I ain't gonna comb my hair<br>
'Cause I ain't going anywhere<br>
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no<br>
I'll just strut in my birthday suit<br>
And let everything hang loose<br>
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,<br>
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
<br>
Ooh<br>
Today I don't feel like doing anything<br>
I just wanna lay in my bed<br>
Don't feel like picking up my phone<br>

    <p>Did I disappoint you or let you down?<br>
Should I be feeling guilty<br>
or let the judges frown?<br>
'Cause I saw the end<br>
before we'd begun,<br>
Yes I saw you were blinded<br>
and I knew I had won.<br>
So I took what's mine by eternal right.<br>
Took your soul out into the night.<br>
It may be over but it won't stop there,<br>
I am here for you if you'd only care.<br>
You touched my heart you touched my soul.<br>
You changed my life and all my goals.<br>
And love is blind and that I knew when,<br>
My heart was blinded by you.<br>
I've kissed your lips and held your hand.<br>
Shared your dreams and shared your bed.<br>
I know you well, I know your smell.<br>
I've been addicted to you.<br>
<br>
<br>
Goodbye my lover.<br>
Goodbye my friend.<br>
You have been the one.<br>
You have been the one for me.<br>
<br>
I am a dreamer and when I wake,<br>
You can't break my spirit<br>
- it's my dreams you take.<br>
And as you move on, remember me,<br>
Remember us and all we used to be<br>
I've seen you cry, I've seen you smile.<br>
I've watched you sleeping for a while.<br>
I'd be the father of your child.<br>
I'd spend a lifetime with you.<br>
I know your fears and you know mine.<br>
We've had our doubts but now we're fine,<br>
And I love you, I swear that's true.<br>
I cannot live without you.<br>
<br>
<br>
Goodbye my lover.<br>
Goodbye my friend.<br>
You have been the one.<br>
You have been the one for me.<br>
<br>
And I still hold your hand in mine.<br>
In mine when I'm asleep.<br>
And I will bare my soul in time,<br>
When I'm kneeling at your feet.<br>
<br>
<br>
Goodbye my lover.<br>
Goodbye my friend.<br>
You have been the one.<br>
You have been the one for me.<br>
<br>
I'm so hollow, baby, I'm so hollow.<br>
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so hollow.<br>
I'm so hollow, baby, I'm so hollow.<br>
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so hollow.
